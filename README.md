## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is a **practice ground**, not a polished library. It reflects how a developer actually thinks and writes code while mastering a new language. 

**This repo exists to:**
* **Practice core Go concepts** through hands-on challenges.
* **Show real learning progress**, including mistakes and "non-idiomatic" starts.
* **Encourage refactoring**—turning 10-line functions into 5 clean lines is where the magic happens.
* **Help others** see how understanding evolves over time.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **The Golden Rule:** Try solving each challenge on your own **before** looking at the solution. The goal is learning, not copying.

## 🧩 How to Use This Repo

Learning happens in the gap between *your attempt* and *a better one*.

1.  **Read** the challenge description.
2.  **Solve** it your way first.
3.  **Compare** with the `/solutions` (use them as reference, not gospel).
4.  **Refactor** and optimize until it feels like "clean Go."
