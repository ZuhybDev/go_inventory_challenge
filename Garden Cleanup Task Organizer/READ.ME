 Write a function organizeGardenTasks that takes plants, heights, methods and returns a sorted slice of task strings.

The function identifies which plants need support (height ≤ 30cm) or replacement (height ≤ 15cm), creates formatted task strings, and sorts them prioritizing gentle methods and shorter plants.

Logic:

Plants ≤ 15cm need "replace", plants 16-30cm need "support"
Create task strings: "<plant>: <action> by <method>"
Sort by: gentle methods first ("trim" before "prune"), then by plant height (ascending)
Parameters:

plants ([]string): Plant names
heights ([]int): Plant heights in cm
methods ([]string): Volunteer methods ("trim" or "prune")
Returns: Slice of formatted task strings, sorted by method priority then height. Format: ["rose: replace by trim", "daisy: support by prune"]
